# DonkeyKong

Ever since I was 12 I have wanted to create games, I tried learning how to make them using Unreal but that failed as I was trying to learn both how to code and how to use the engine. This project demonstrates how I learned to code, learned the basics of game development and what a game needs, and then learned how to use a game engine. I created Donkey Kong using Java and the Processing library from scratch. I created a movement, collision, animation, and physics system along with implementing audio. While not the cleanest code or product, after this project I felt confident in my ability to be able to learn a game engine quickly and know more about what is actually happening behind the scenes.
